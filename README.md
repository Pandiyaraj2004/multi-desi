# 🩺 Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease based on user-input health parameters. The goal is to assist in early detection and risk assessment using AI.

---

## 📌 Features

- Predicts:
  - Diabetes
  - Heart Disease
  - Parkinson's Disease
- User-friendly command-line interface or web interface (optional)
- Trained with popular ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- High accuracy with real-world datasets

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit / Flask (for web interface, optional)
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
